Below is a **single, copy-paste–ready prompt** you can drop directly into **Replit Design Mode**.
It is written to force **pixel-accurate visual parity** with the attached screenshot and to prevent Replit from “interpreting” or redesigning anything.

## Replit Design Mode Prompt — Swap Modal (Exact Match)

**Context**

You are updating the **Swap modal** for a DeFi application called **Mantua.AI**.
A **reference screenshot is attached**.
Your job is to make the Swap modal look **exactly like the screenshot**, with no stylistic deviations.

This is **not a redesign**.
This is a **visual replication task**.

---

## Hard Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

* Match the **layout, spacing, typography, colors, shadows, borders, and hierarchy** exactly
* Dark theme only
* No additional UI elements
* No removed UI elements
* No creative interpretation
* No “improvements”
* If something appears subtle (glow, divider, opacity), **replicate it**

---

## Overall Layout

* Two-panel layout:

  * **Left:** Chart + market stats
  * **Right:** Swap modal card
* Panels are visually separated but share the same background tone
* Rounded corners throughout (large radius, soft)
* Subtle inner glow and border on cards
* Background is near-black with deep navy undertones

---

## Final Instruction

**Use the attached screenshot as the single source of truth.**
If there is any ambiguity, **default to matching the screenshot exactly** rather than guessing.

Do not explain your changes.
Only update the UI to match the reference.
