Below is a **single, copy-paste-ready prompt** you can drop directly into **Replit Design Mode** (or Replit AI) to update your existing Swap interface to match the **exact structure, behavior, and UX intent** of the React implementation you provided.

This prompt is written to **replace the current Swap UI**, not refactor logic unless required.

## Replit Design Mode Prompt — Mantua Swap Interface Upgrade

**Context**
You are working inside an existing React + Tailwind (or inline-style) codebase for a DeFi application called **Mantua**.
There is already a Swap page/component. Your task is to **update the Swap interface UI and UX** to match the specification below.

This is a **production-grade trading interface**, not a mockup or demo.
Do **not** simplify the UI. Do **not** remove advanced features.

---

## Objective

Replace the current Swap interface with a **two-column, execution-first Swap experience** that:

1. Preserves the chatbot / AI narrative layer
2. Makes Uniswap v4 hooks feel **powerful but optional**
3. Supports **inline hook preview + modal selection**
4. Surfaces **fee architecture, savings, and protection**
5. Looks credible next to Uniswap, CowSwap, and Coinbase Advanced

---

## High-Level Layout (Non-Negotiable)

### Page Layout

* Centered container
* Max width ≈ **900px**
* Two columns:

  * **Left (≈420px): Swap Panel**
  * **Right (flex): Price Chart + Market Stats**
* Light background (`#fafafa`)
* White cards with subtle purple accents

---

## Required Components (Must Match Behavior)

### 1. AI Response Banner (Top)

* Full-width banner above the swap
* Shows:

  * Swap intent summary (e.g. “Swapping 1.5 ETH → USDC”)
  * Why a hook was auto-selected
  * Estimated savings
  * Mini sparkline chart
* This must feel like a **chatbot response rendered inline**, not a toast

---

### 2. Swap Panel (Left Column)

#### Header

* Title: **Swap**
* Settings icon (no modal required yet)

#### Token Inputs

* Two stacked token cards:

  * Sell (ETH)
  * Buy (USDC)
* Each card includes:

  * Amount input (large mono font)
  * Token selector button (icon + symbol)
  * Balance
  * USD equivalent
* Center swap-direction button floating between cards

---

### 3. Hook Selection (Critical)

#### Inline Hook Preview (Default)

* A single selectable row showing:

  * Selected hook icon
  * Hook name
  * Estimated savings
  * “Change” CTA
* Clicking opens **Hook Selector Modal**

#### Expandable Inline List

* “Show All / Collapse” toggle
* Shows **top 3 hooks** in compact form
* “View All Hooks & Custom Address” CTA

---

### 4. Hook Selector Modal

Must include:

#### Header

* Title: **Select Swap Hook**
* Close button

#### AI Recommendation Banner

* Explains *why* a hook is recommended
* Contextual to trade size

#### Hook Options

Each hook card supports:

* Icon
* Name
* Description
* Benefit pill
* Optional tags:

  * `Recommended`
  * `New`
* Selected state with checkmark

Hooks to include:

* Auto (Smart Routing)
* MEV Protection (recommended)
* Directional Fee
* JIT Rebalancing
* No Hook

#### Custom Hook Address (Expandable)

* Toggle section
* Input for `0x…` address
* Validate button with states:

  * loading
  * valid
  * invalid
* Show:

  * Hook name
  * Permissions
  * Audit status
* Recent custom hooks list

#### Apply Button

* Applies hook and closes modal

---

### 5. Swap Details Section

Inline breakdown card showing:

* Rate
* Network fee
* **Fee Architecture (v4-specific)**

  * LP Fee (dynamic)
  * Protocol Fee
  * Hook Fee
* Price impact
* Slippage
* Hook benefit (savings)

This section must **teach** users how v4 fees work.

---

### 6. Swap Execution Button

* Full-width
* Gradient purple
* Text includes selected hook name:

  * “Swap ETH → USDC with MEV Protection”

---

### 7. Chart Panel (Right Column)

#### Price Chart Card

* ETH / USDC
* Candlestick-style visualization
* Timeframe toggles (1H / 4H / 1D / 1W)
* Current price + % change

#### Market Stat Cards

* 24h Volume
* Pool TVL
* Current Fee

---

## Implementation Rules

* You may:

  * Create new components if needed
  * Reorganize layout and JSX
* You may NOT:

  * Remove hook logic
  * Remove advanced fee explanations
  * Replace with placeholders
* Keep logic mock-friendly if data is not wired yet
* Prefer composability and readability

---

## Visual Style

* White cards
* Soft purple accents (`#8b5cf6`, `#6366f1`)
* Rounded corners (12–20px)
* Subtle borders
* No heavy shadows
* Typography:

  * System UI
  * Monospace for prices and addresses

---

## Final Instruction

**Implement this as the new Swap interface UI.**
If something already exists, **upgrade it** to match this spec rather than duplicating it.

Do not explain the changes.
Do not summarize.
Only produce the updated implementation.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Convert this into a **pure Tailwind version**
* Break this into **atomic components**
* Adapt it to **OnchainKit / wagmi execution**
* Refactor it for **chat-embedded rendering** instead of a standalone page
