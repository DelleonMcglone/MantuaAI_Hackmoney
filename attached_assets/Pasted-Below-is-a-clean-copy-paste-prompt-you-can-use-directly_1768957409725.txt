Below is a **clean, copy-paste prompt** you can use directly in **Replit Design Mode, v0, or any UI generation workflow**. It is intentionally precise and implementation-ready.

## Liquidity Modal Invocation — Prompt

**Context**
You are building a chat-native DeFi interface where core actions (Swap, Liquidity) render as **modals layered above the chatbot**, not as page navigations.

The Liquidity experience must mirror the Swap experience in both **visual hierarchy** and **interaction logic**.

---

### Liquidity Modal Trigger Rules

Implement the following behavior exactly:

#### 1. Sidebar Interaction (Primary Trigger)

* When a user clicks **“Liquidity”** in the sidebar:

  * Render the **Liquidity modal**
  * The modal appears **above the chatbot**, identical to how the **Swap modal** is displayed
  * The chatbot remains visible in the background but is **non-interactive** while the modal is open
  * Do **not** navigate to a new page or route

---

#### 2. Chat Intent Trigger (Natural Language)

* When a user types **“Add Liquidity”** (case-insensitive) into the chatbot input:

  * Immediately display the **Liquidity modal**
  * Do **not** send a text response from the chatbot
  * Do **not** show a confirmation message
  * The modal opening itself is the response

Examples that must trigger the modal:

* `Add Liquidity`
* `add liquidity`
* `I want to add liquidity`
* `add liquidity to a pool`

---

#### 3. Modal Parity with Swap

The Liquidity modal must follow the same rules as the Swap modal:

* Same z-index and overlay behavior
* Same animation timing and easing
* Same close behavior (× icon or backdrop click)
* Same visual layering above the chat interface

Liquidity is treated as a **first-class execution modal**, not a secondary feature.

---

#### 4. Intent Priority (Important)

* Liquidity intent **overrides** normal chatbot replies
* If intent = liquidity:

  * Render modal
  * Skip LLM response
  * No fallback text

---

### Design Outcome

The user should feel that:

* Liquidity is an **action**, not a conversation
* Natural language is a **shortcut to execution**
* The system behaves consistently across Swap and Liquidity

If the user knows how to open Swap, they already know how Liquidity works.

---

If you want next, I can:

* Add **Remove Liquidity** intent handling
* Define **Create Pool vs Add Liquidity** branching
* Write the **intent-parser rules** explicitly
* Or map this directly to your existing Liquidity component logic
