## Refined Prompt for Replit Design Mode

**Task**: Restructure the sidebar navigation layout

### Changes Required:

**1. Remove the following elements entirely:**
- The "LINKS" section header
- "About" link with external link icon
- "Docs" link with document icon
- "X" link with X/Twitter icon

**2. Reorder the sidebar navigation:**

The new order from top to bottom should be:
1. New Chat (keep at top with purple/accent color)
2. Swap
3. Liquidity
4. Agent
5. Portfolio (with expandable dropdown)
6. Faucet
7. **Recent Chats section** (moved here, below Faucet)

**3. Recent Chats section styling:**
- Add a subtle divider or spacing above "Recent Chats" to visually separate it from the main navigation items
- Remove the collapse/expand chevron - this section should always be expanded
- Display all recent chat entries as a scrollable list directly in the sidebar
- Each chat entry should show a truncated chat title/preview
- Style similar to Claude.ai's sidebar: recent chats appear as a dedicated scrollable section at the bottom of the sidebar with each chat as a clickable row

**4. Recent Chat item hover behavior:**
- On hover, the chat row should have a subtle background highlight
- On hover, display a trash/delete icon on the right side of the chat row
- The delete icon should only be visible when hovering over that specific chat item
- The delete icon should have its own hover state (e.g., turn red or show tooltip "Delete chat")

**5. Delete confirmation and undo flow:**
- When the delete icon is clicked, show a small confirmation popover/tooltip near the delete icon with two options: "Delete" (destructive/red) and "Cancel"
- If "Cancel" is clicked, close the popover and do nothing
- If "Delete" is clicked, remove the chat from the list with a smooth fade-out animation
- After deletion, show a toast notification at the bottom of the screen: "Chat deleted" with an "Undo" button
- The toast should auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- If "Undo" is clicked before the toast dismisses, restore the chat to its original position in the list with a fade-in animation
- After the toast dismisses (or if undo is not clicked), permanently delete the chat

**6. Visual hierarchy:**
- Main navigation items (New Chat through Faucet): Primary navigation styling
- Recent Chats section: Secondary styling with slightly muted text, smaller font size, and individual chat entries as list items
- Toast notification: Subtle dark background with white text, positioned bottom-center or bottom-right of the viewport

This now includes a two-step safety net: confirmation before delete and undo after delete. Want me to add anything else, like bulk delete functionality or keyboard shortcuts?
