## Duplicate Icon Declaration Fix — Prompt

**Context**
You are working in a Vite + React + TypeScript application. The app is failing to compile due to **duplicate identifier declarations** caused by inline icon components defined multiple times in the same file.

---

## Problem to Resolve

The build is failing with the error:

> `Identifier 'WalletIcon' has already been declared`

This means the same icon component (e.g. `WalletIcon`) is declared more than once **within the same module scope**, which is invalid in JavaScript / TypeScript.

This commonly occurs when UI blocks are copied into a large file (such as `app.tsx`) and each block defines its own inline icons.

---

## Required Fix (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Centralize Icon Definitions

* Create a **single shared icon file**:

  ```
  client/src/components/icons.tsx
  ```
* Move **all SVG icon components** (WalletIcon, SwapIcon, BotIcon, etc.) into this file
* Each icon must be declared **exactly once**
* Export each icon as a named export

Example:

```tsx
export const WalletIcon = () => (
  <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="2">
    <path d="M21 12V7H5a2 2 0 0 1 0-4h14v4"/>
    <path d="M3 5v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h16v-5"/>
    <path d="M18 12a2 2 0 0 0 0 4h4v-4h-4z"/>
  </svg>
);
```

---

### 2. Import Icons Where Needed

* In `app.tsx` (and any other file):

  * Remove **all inline icon declarations**
  * Import icons from the shared file

Example:

```ts
import { WalletIcon } from "@/components/icons";
```

---

### 3. Explicit Constraints

❌ Do NOT declare icon components inline inside page files
❌ Do NOT duplicate icon names in the same file
❌ Do NOT suppress the error using `vite.hmr.overlay = false`

This error must be **fixed at the source**, not hidden.

---

## Optional Temporary Fix (Not Recommended)

If unblocking is needed immediately:

* Rename duplicate icons locally:

  ```ts
  const SidebarWalletIcon = () => ( ... );
  const PortfolioWalletIcon = () => ( ... );
  ```

This is acceptable only as a short-term workaround and should be replaced with centralized icons.

---

## Expected Outcome

* The app compiles successfully
* No duplicate identifier errors
* Icons are reusable, consistent, and maintainable
* `app.tsx` no longer contains inline SVG icon definitions

---

## Success Criteria

* No `Identifier has already been declared` errors
* All icons imported from a single source
* Clean, deterministic build on refresh and restart

---

If you want next, I can:

* Refactor your entire icon set cleanly
* Split `app.tsx` safely into modular components
* Define a naming convention to prevent future collisions

Tell me the next step.
